# Planned revisions to reproduction of Malcomb (2014)

## Analysis

I plan to critique the data used to make the drought and flood risk index, which makes up an entire 40% of the Vulnerability index. The data is low spatial resolution, especially flood risk, and I am worried that it is weighted too heavily, especially since the resolution is made higher artificially, a step that greatly increases uncertainty. 

I plan to reweight flood risk proportionally to the cell size of the drought risk raster, in response to the fact that because of the low spatial resolution of that layer, there is far less certainty about its effects. 


## Results
How will my results be visible? How will I know they worked?
My results will be visible when mapped, in comparison to the replicated study. I can also map the difference between my final Vulnerability compared to the control, like the replication does.
